Adds a simple "Notes" section to the admin menu for taking down....notes

== Description ==

Like a built in notepad, can leave notes for clients or yourself.  

Features :  

*  Uses WordPress's built in custom post types    
*  Works like a regular post    
*  Functions with default WYSIWYG editor    
*  Shows all "Notes" on one page in tab format    
*  Will not show in front end or search    
*  Requires default post privileges   


Notes :

*  Preview button does not work, as WordPress makes it difficult to get rid of, just ignore it.
*  Aligning images might make it look weird.
*  Careful with the editor Markup as any broken or unclosed tags will effect the jQuery UI.
*  Not sure what happens if you add more then 8 or so notes to the tab styling.
